# ME 50900 - Intermediate Fluid Mechanics

This is a GitHub repository for ME 50900 - Intermediate Fluid Mechanics at Purdue University, as taught by Prof. Ivan C. Christov.
The repository mainly consists of Jupyter notebooks used for hands-on demos, enrichment activities, and problem-set solutions.
The notebooks are unlikely to be robust and may require updates to run as underlying Python libraries evolve.
