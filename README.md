# ME 50900 - Intermediate Fluid Mechanics

This is a GitHub repository for ME 50900 - Intermediate Fluid Mechanics at Purdue University, as taught by Prof. [Ivan C. Christov](HTTPS://christov.tmnt-lab.org).
The repository mainly consists of Jupyter notebooks used for hands-on demos, enrichment activities, and problem-set solutions.

The notebooks are unlikely to be robust and may require updates to run on different platforms, and as underlying Python libraries evolve.

Some resources for getting started:
* Google Colaboratory lets open Jupyter notebooks from GitHub and run them in the cloud from your browser: https://colab.research.google.com
* ME 297 - Introduction to Data Science for Mechanical Engineers: https://github.com/PurdueMechanicalEngineering/me-297-intro-to-data-science (first few lectures cover getting started with Scientific Python)
* Python for Everybody: https://www.py4e.com
* Getting started with Markdown (for how to write nice discussion between your computational cells in the Jupyter notebook): https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/
